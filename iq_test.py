    """
    Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to find out which one 
    of the given numbers differs from the others. Bob observed that one number usually differs from 
    the others in evenness. Help Bob â€” to check his answers, he needs a program that among the given 
    numbers finds one that is different in evenness, and return a position of this number.
    
    Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test, which means indexes of the elements 
    start from 1 (not 0)
